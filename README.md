# Banking-Application
I developed a multilayered banking application REST API using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. This robust API includes essential CRUD operations for managing user accounts, allowing easy creation, deletion, and updating of users. 

In addition to the basic operations, the API also supports credit and deposit transactions, ensuring smooth and secure financial operations. The system architecture is designed for scalability and efficiency, with layers separating business logic, data access, and service communication, ensuring clean code and maintainability.

It’s been an exciting journey building this from the ground up, and I’m eager to continue refining and expanding its capabilities.
